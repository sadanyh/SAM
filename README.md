# SAM
 Sentiment Aware Metric
SAM is a new measure for assessing MT performance that takes into account the sentiment similarity between the MT system translation, i.e. the hypothesis, and the reference. This sentiment measure should be used as a fine-tuning tool to adjust a metric score in cases where the translation quality of sentiment-oriented text is evaluated. The SAM score is calculated by using the SentiWord dictionary of prior polarities.
